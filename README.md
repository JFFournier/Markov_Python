# Markov_Python
CodeAcademy.com Python project: Creates new lyrics using a Markov Chain

 Requires BeautifulSoup and urllib2

Just run 'run_lyrics_generator.py' in Python (2.7) to run this program.

If like me you have crappy internet, your internet box might get confused hitting http://www.azlyrics.com/ so many times and you may need to reset it. In that case, just edit the default_lists.py. If you still want to use all the texts, you can merge the text/title_from_url.txt files.
